Metadata regarding each flag is noted, while a historical narrative is written in regards to the political and cultural dynamics at play that mandated the flag changes. Each flag goes through an investigative process of a visual breakdown, examining colors, symbols, text, and image in relation to the meaning, culture, and ideologies they represent.

Utilizing this methodology, an entire history of the modern nation state of Afghanistan can be told, processed, and retold through its own flags. Novel and insightful findings reveal themselves that would otherwise be lost or impossible to decipher through a textual or literary reading.
