Wrapped up my first year (and first time) teaching design at the California College of the Arts. 

I have the honor of teaching the beautiful souls of the MFA Design program how to program websites through the design process; websites that act as whatever they want them to be. The year ended with a collaborative classroom made website for the graduating show [Interference](https://mfadesign2023.cca.edu/).
