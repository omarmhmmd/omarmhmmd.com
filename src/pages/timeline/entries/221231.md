Published my first Farsi-Arabic script typeface titled [Bamyan](https://bamyan.omarmhmmd.com/).

Bamyan is a design project exploring the possibilities of a cultural typeface designed specifically for a region of Afghanistan. It's not much, but it's a trying contribution to the cultural design language of Afghanistan.[^1]
