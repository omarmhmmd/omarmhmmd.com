Exhibited the [Bamyan typeface](https://bamyan.omarmhmmd.com/) in Seoul for [Unrealized Archive 7: Text to Image](https://unrealizedarchive.com/text-to-image/omar-mohammad/), a project by Chris Hamamoto & Jon Sueda exploring speculative and “unrealized” design through systematic conceptual approaches.

[^1]Unrealized Archive uncovers “unrealized” graphic design projects that consumed many hours—sometimes years—of work, but were never produced. Unlike in architecture and product design, where “unbuilt” or “speculative” work is forefronted as an important subject of critical discourse, most of these projects have until now been buried in flat files or deep in hard-drive storage.
