Invited by Professor Patrick LeMieux to give a keynote at the [2025 UC Davis Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/jam-sites/2025/uc-davis). 

I spoke about culture as design, and design as culture, making reference to the work of one of Afghanistan's first "modern" architects Abdullah Breshna and his advocacy for design based on place and culture.
